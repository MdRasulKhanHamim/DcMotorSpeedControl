# DcMotorSpeedControl
DC Motor Speed Control Simulation Project in PSPICE for EEE 208 S
The project has been created in PSPICE software. Open the .sch or schematic file in PSPICE to see the circuit diagram and simulate it to observe the waveforms. You can tune the pot to obtain different duty cycles
